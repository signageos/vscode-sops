Additionally, it's available on Open VSX market place https://open-vsx.org/extension/signageos/signageos-vscode-sops

## Features

VSCode extension with underlying [SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) supports:
- Realtime editing of encrypted `yaml`, `json`, `dotenv`, `plaintext`, `binary` and `ini` files in-place in your project.
- Create new encrypted yaml/json file using `.sops.yaml` config creation_rules if available.

This extension works with binaries `sops / age / ...` installed via [aquaproj/aqua](https://aquaproj.github.io/).

## Requirements

- Download and install SOPS from here: https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases

*Make sure that `sops` is available in $PATH environment variable*

- Tutorial to SOPS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2PRhxphH2w
- *(optional)* For dotenv support install https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv extension first

## Extension Settings
* `sops.enable`: enable/disable this extension (default: true)
* `sops.beta`: enable/disable beta release without reloading VSCode or enabling/disabling extensions (default: false)
* `sops.binPath`: Path to SOPS binary (default: executables from `$PATH`)
* `sops.configPath`: Path (absolute or relative) to the configuration for this extension (empty: defaults to `.sopsrc` in root of project) See [Config file](#config-file) section.
* `sops.defaults.awsProfile`: Default AWS profile name which will be used for sops command `--aws-profile` (empty: defaults to environment variable `$AWS_PROFILE`)
* `sops.defaults.gcpCredentialsPath`: Default path used to find GCP credentials. Overrides the `$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable (empty: defaults to environment variable `$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`)
* `sops.defaults.ageKeyFile`: Default path used to find AGE key file. Overwrites the `$SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE` environment variable (default: uses from environment variable `$SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE`)

## Config file
> Named `.sopsrc` in project root by default and is in YAML format.
```yaml
awsProfile: my-profile-1
gcpCredentialsPath: /home/user/Downloads/my-key.json
ageKeyFile: /home/user/age.txt
```

## Beta releases
The new features are published immediately into different extension package https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=signageos.signageos-vscode-sops-beta

The beta extension package is installed automatically and is disabled by default.

If you'd like to try new features, just enable configuration `"sops.beta": true` in global (or workspace) config file and changes are applied immediately.

You can switch beta configuration globally easily using commands `sops.enable_beta`/`sops.disable_beta`.

I recommend to have enabled beta release to test everything as soon as possible. If something went wrong in beta release, just easily rollback to `"sops.beta" false` and report an issue here: https://github.com/signageos/vscode-sops/issues

> The reason is that vscode doesn't support beta releases built-in. See and vote for https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/15756

## SOPS differ
Optionally, you can add following file `.gitattributes` into your project
```
encrypted/*.{yaml,json,ini,env} diff=sopsdiffer
```
and run following command for global git settings
```sh
git config --global diff.sopsdiffer.textconv "sops -d --config /dev/null"
```
to see the git diff in decrypted format.
